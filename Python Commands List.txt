**************** COMMANDS FOR RESET THE EXPNESE & ADVANCE REQUEST ID's**********************************************
Option 2: Keep the database but clear only the tables
Run python manage.py flush (clears all data across the database) and confirm the prompt.
This also resets all auto-increment counters.

Alternatively, clear specific tables and reset their sequences:

python manage.py dbshell
DELETE FROM expenses_expense;
DELETE FROM expenses_advancerequest;
DELETE FROM sqlite_sequence WHERE name IN ('expenses_expense','expenses_advancerequest');
.quit
Then restart your app and add new records; IDs begin from 1 again.

These steps apply to the Expense and AdvanceRequest models defined in expenses/models.py, which rely on default auto-incrementing IDs
